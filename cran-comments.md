* unable to verify current time

There were also some spelling mistakes flagged for the words, "Prvan", 
"Tierney", and "brolgar". The first two words are the last names of co-authors
of the package, whose names are mentioned in the prescribed format for referring
to existing authored work. The last work, "brolgar", is the name of the R 
package, which appears in the title of the authored work.

I am not sure how to rectify the issue with "unable to verify current time", 
however my understanding is that this is due to an issue with a service
that provides time stamps, and not something that is from my package.
