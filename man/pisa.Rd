\title{Student data from 2000-2018 PISA OECD data}
\format{
A tibble of the following variables
\itemize{
\item year the year of measurement
\item country the three letter country code. This data contains Australia,
New Zealand, and Indonesia. The full data from learningtower contains
99 countries.
\item school_id The unique school identification number
\item student_id The student identification number
\item gender recorded gender - 1 female or 2 male or missing
\item math Simulated score in mathematics
\item read Simulated score in reading
\item science Simulated score in science
\item stu_wgt The final survey weight score for the student score
}

Understanding a bit more about the PISA data, the \code{school_id} and
\code{student_id} are not unique across time. This means the longitudinal element
is the country within a given year.

We can cast \code{pisa} as a \code{tsibble}, but we need to aggregate the data to each
year and country. In doing so, it is important that we provide some summary
statistics of each of the scores - we want to include the mean, and minimum
and maximum of the math, reading, and science scores, so that we do not lose
the information of the individuals.

The example code below does this, first grouping by year and country, then
calculating the weighted mean for math, reading, and science. This can be
done using the student weight variable \code{stu_wgt}, to get the survey weighted
mean. The minimum and maximum are then calculated.
