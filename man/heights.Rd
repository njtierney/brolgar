\title{World Height Data}
\format{
An object of class \code{tbl_ts} (inherits from \code{tbl_df}, \code{tbl}, \code{data.frame}) with 1490 rows and 4 columns.
}
\usage{
heights
}
\description{
Average male heights in 144 countries from 1810-1989, with a
smaller number of countries from 1500-1800. Data has been filtered to
only include countries with more than one observation.
}
\details{
\code{heights} is stored as a time series \code{tsibble} object. It contains
the variables:
\itemize{
\item country: The Country. This forms the identifying \code{key}.
\item year: Year. This forms the time \code{index}.
\item height_cm: Average male height in centimeters.
\item continent: continent extracted from country name using \code{countrycode}
package (https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00848).
}
